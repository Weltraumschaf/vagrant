# Install a Virtual macOS

For testing Ansible setup of macOS Build slaves we need a virtual installation. In this [tutorial](https://www.howtogeek.com/289594/how-to-install-macos-sierra-in-virtualbox-on-windows-10/) it is described for Windows hosts, but this is easy adaptable for macOS hosts.

There is a script (`create_iso.sh`) to create a ISO image mountable by VirtualBox from the High Sierra installer (`Install macOS High Sierra.app`). It is described where and how to download the installer from Apple.
